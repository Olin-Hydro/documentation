Hydroponics could be the future of agriculture (dare we say aquaculture) because of hydroponic gardens\u2019 compactness, fast growth, resistance to pests, and lower water consumption.</p>"},{"location":"#our-goals","title":"Our Goals","text":"<p>As a PInT subteam one of our primary goals is to help you learn and grow as individuals by doing. If you\u2019re not passionate about any of the existing subprojects that we\u2019re working on, then talk to your lead and we can find a fit for you.</p> <p>Automation\u2019s goal is to create a living garden; that is, a garden that can give itself more water or nutrient substrate when it\u2019s needed. We\u2019re implementing this using a microcontroller that should check plant metrics (pH, water content, etc.) and deliver the nutrients a plan needs to survive. We plan to allow the community to interact with the hydro wall without needing to be there in person, so we have designed an API and are constantly improving our API and frontend dashboard so that we provide a good user experience.</p>"},{"location":"#to-contribute","title":"To Contribute:","text":"<p>Visit our Computational Setup and Install Packages pages, which detail how you can install the software you need to succeed on Hydroponics.</p> <p>Computational Setup - General</p> <p>Install Packages</p> <p>Our GitHub is organized into several subdirectories, each with a focus on one aspect of the Hydro automation workflow.

Here\u2019s how Amazon Web Services describes it: API \u201cdefines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses.\u201d</p> <p>We are constructing a path where the microcontrollers, database, and the frontend dashboard can all interact with each other and communicate. Currently, we are using a REST API architecture with routes built for <code>GET</code>ting, <code>POST</code>ing, and updating (<code>PUT</code>ting):</p> <ul> <li>Configuration settings (<code>Config</code>) for scheduling sensor readings (<code>SensorSchedule</code>) and actuators (<code>SASchedule</code>, <code>RASchedule</code>)</li> <li>Gardens (<code>Garden</code>), pods (<code>Pod</code>), sensors (<code>Sensor</code>), reactive actuators (<code>Reactive_Actuator</code>), and scheduled actuators (<code>Scheduled_Actuator</code>)</li> <li>Commands (<code>Command</code>) for a specific execution of an actuator</li> <li>Various logs for sensors (<code>Reading</code>), scheduled actions (<code>Scheduled_Action</code>), and reactive actions (<code>Reactive_Action</code>)</li> </ul> <p>This API uses FastAPI framework and AWS Lambda function to host.
